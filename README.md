* Tested on: (TODO) Windows 22, i7-2222 @ 2.22GHz 22GB, GTX 222 222MB (Moore 2222 Lab)
  * Note: eventual machine will not be one of the Moore lab machines; will instead be running with a GTX 1650 graphics card, with no DXR

### README

As an initial note: this project is slightly premature for me; I'm still acquiring parts to put together a working machine for this class, so I will need to do all these steps again sometime next week.
As for specs, it will be running a Intel Core i3-9100F Coffee Lake 4-Core 3.6 GHz processor, along with a Geforce GTX1650 graphics card, with 16GB of RAM.

By that same token, I was also not able to do any of the DXR elements of the assignment.

#### Subsection 1

The chrome set-up worked fine, as shown by this screenshot showing the ability to make use of WebGL:

Include screenshots, analysis, etc. (Remember, this is public, so don't put
anything here that you don't want to share with the world.)
